This meeting is for you if you like to move and want to develop!\n\nPump classes are weight training (small/medium), in which we engage all the largest muscle groups. The exercises performed to the rhythm of music are simple, there is no element of complex choreography. You don't have to be afraid of weights, you choose them according to the exercises and your capabilities. This training burns calories, shapes and firms the entire body, strengthens the spine muscles and has a beneficial effect on the skeletal and joint system. You choose the intensity depending on the weight you use ;)\n\nThe workshops last 2 hours and consist of 2 parts:\n- 1 part devoted to discussing and learning/training exercises that take place during barbell classes\n- Part 2 is pure practice, i.e. demonstration classes conducted to appropriately composed music.\n\nThe meeting is led by Katarzyna Mocek - qualified fitness instructor and personal trainer.",
